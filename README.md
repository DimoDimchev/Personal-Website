# Personal-Website
This is a repository for my personal website, built with Django
<br>
<br>
For this project I decided to practice my Django skills and wanted to improve my CSS skills as well as to showcase all of the work I've done in the past 6 months.
Almost the whole site consists of only Python, HTML and CSS, without any JavaScript(I decided not to do a SPA). The database I'm using is a PostgreSQL database and it is managed via the Django Admin that comes integrated with every Django Project
<br>
<br>
The project includes the following functionalities:
- Completely responsive design
- Landing page
- Projects showcase
- Individual pages for each project
- Blog
- About section
